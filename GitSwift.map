## File Types & Relationships
- **.jsx/.tsx**: React components
  - Related: CSS modules, context providers
- **.js/.ts**: Utility functions, hooks, API calls
  - Related: API endpoints, context consumers
- **.css/.scss**: Styling
  - Related: Component files that import them
- **.html**: Static pages and documentation
  - Related: CSS files, asset references
- **package.json**: Dependencies and scripts
  - Related: All source files that import packages
- **.worker.js**: Web worker scripts (planned)

## UI Layer Sequence (Front to Back)
1. **User Interface Layer**: React components (src/components/)
2. **Page Structure Layer**: Page layouts (src/pages/)
3. **State Management Layer**: Context providers (src/context/)
4. **Data Fetching Layer**: API calls and hooks (src/api/, src/hooks/)
5. **Utility Layer**: Helper functions (src/utils/)
6. **Backend Integration**: External APIs and services
7. **Web Worker Layer**: Background processing (planned) (src/workers/)
8. **Plugin System**: Extensibility layer (planned) (src/plugins/)

## Workflow
1. User interacts with UI components
2. Components trigger state changes via context
3. State changes trigger API calls when needed
4. API responses update state
5. Updated state flows back to components
6. UI updates to reflect new state
7. Heavy operations offloaded to web workers (planned)
8. Custom functionality via plugin system (planned)
